1) get sum of shortest paths between kitty and mouse and sum it

2) get manhattan dist between kitty and mouse and increase it exponentially the closer it gets

3) consider the amount of kitties in a square around the new mouse place, minimize the amount of kitties in that square

4) consider the amount of cheese left, if there is only one cheese, can be much more bold since game ends when cheese is captured
