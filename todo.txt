figure out how to have dfs preserve visited nodes or at least make it consistent between states
currently only solutions are to essentially force it to use the inital dfs instead of recalculating
dfs currently looping on state change (./AI_search 1525 1 1 2 0)

need to find a way to make h* nokitty more efficient, like in regards to cat's closeness to cheese (see kitty brainstorm)

Still need to test for memory leaks
